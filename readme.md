#Single Page App using Polymer, Sinatra and Postgres

A template for a trivial single page app using Polymer core components for the front end (as outlined here: [Polymer SPA](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/articles/spa.html) ) Sinatra as the DSL and Postgres as the db.

##Note: Currently under heavy development...

##Installation

I'm still figuring out the best way to do this so everything's up in the air right now. Will come back to this readme with installation instructions when I figure it out.

You'll need: 

* Ruby (2.0 or greater) [installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Sinatra [installing Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* Also a good idea to use the Thin webserver [installing Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/)
* Postgresql [installing Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
* Polymer 0.5 [installing Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/getting-the-code.html)

Note: will update to Polymer 0.8 when the components become avaliable.
